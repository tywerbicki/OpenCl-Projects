## OpenCL Projects

### Graphs ###

Currently empty. Eventually, I am hoping to complete a GPU-accelerated implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.

---

### Saxpy ###

The canonical *single-precision* $\alpha\mathbf{\overline{x}} + \mathbf{\overline{y}}$ kernel. This is used as a prototype kernel for code and file organization.

---

### Utilities ###

OpenCL and host utility functions that are useful when working with the OpenCL programming model.
