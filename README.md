## OpenCL Projects

### Saxpy ###

The canonical *single-precision ax + y kernel*:
$$\mathbf{\overline{y}} = \alpha\mathbf{\overline{x}} + \mathbf{\overline{y}} \quad \textrm{where} \quad \mathbf{\overline{x}}, \mathbf{\overline{y}} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}, \textrm{ } \alpha \in \mathbb{R}$$
This is used as a prototype kernel for code and file organization.

### Utilities ###

OpenCL and host utility functions that are useful when working with the OpenCL programming model.

---

### Graphs ###

Currently empty. Eventually, I am hoping to complete a GPU-accelerated implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
